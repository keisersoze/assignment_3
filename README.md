The requirements are specifed inside the Moodle page of the course 
[Advanced algorithms and programming methods - 2 \[CM0470\]](https://moodle.unive.it/mod/page/view.php?id=86516) 

## USAGE
A CMakeLists.txt and it is possible to build the application using CMake 
(see the [Official website](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/)).
We have developed the application using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), thus it is also
possible to import the entire project without any problem inside CLion and build the application
using the provided facilities.
In order to change the example test used, 
modify the `add_executable` instruction inside `CMakeLists.txt` accordingly. The default test is `example7.cc`.
